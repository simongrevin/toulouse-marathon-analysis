# Toulouse Marathon Data Analysis in Python

## 1 : HTML Parser

I used urllib and BeautifulSoup to parse the data from the official website and write it in csv files (years 2013 to 2016 results from marathon runners)

List of data fields :
- place
- bib number
- name
- category
- time


## 2. Number of runners in the different age category


## 3. Finding the regular runners

## 4. Something related to their progression
